# Text Editor

With this assignment we covered PWAs (Progressive Web Apps) and was tasked with creating a text editor using a client / server file structure. I accomplished this by implementing methods to get and store data to an IndexedDB database, I idb (a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API) and babel to use async / await.
